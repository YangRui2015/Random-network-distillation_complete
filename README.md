I add test and show function to the original codes.
To use my codes, you need to replace the original codes with my two python files first. 

you can use "python run_atari.py --test True --render True" to show the train results of the models,

also, you can use "python run_atari.py --save_freq 10" to train a model and set how often to save a model.
